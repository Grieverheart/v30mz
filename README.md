# V30MZ core

My first HDL project, a V30MZ core written in SystemVerilog.

# TODO

* Add segment register file and implement writing from EU. Should we use a separate bus?
* Implement alu and microinstruction handling.
* Implement microassembler.
* Implement pipelining by decoupling the execution state.
